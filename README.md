The recent years has been a technological revolution. Before, nobody had a phone that could do more than calling and
texting. But things have changed ever since, and everyone has at least one device that can do much more than that. Along
with these devices there are a lot of new applications, and these applications come with a price, which is all the data
that is collected and used by companies. This data has a lot of value, and the companies knows it and so does everyone.

Nowadays, there is an opportunity in Europe to request this data by using the GDPR laws. The data can be looked at, and
maybe be used to a certain extent, but for the average user it is useless. The data is not comprehensible, it must be
converted to another non-technical format to be understood. But there is more to the data than just reading and
understanding it, it has value even if it has already been used and processed by other companies. This data can be
utilized in various ways, it does not need to be the same way that other companies have used it, but it is a
possibility. Moreover, the requests themselves could be utilized for the benefit of the users.
